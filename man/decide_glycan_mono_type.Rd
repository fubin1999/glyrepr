\title{Decide the Type of Monosaacharides in a Glycan Graph}
\usage{
decide_glycan_mono_type(glycan)
}
\arguments{
\item{glycan}{A glycan graph.}
}
\value{
A character string specifying the monosaccharide type.
}
\description{
This function trys to decide the type of monosaccharides in a glycan graph.
}
\details{
By saying "trys" in the description, it means that the function only
checks the first monosaccharide in the graph to decide the type.
This is reasonable because the monosaccharides in a glycan graph are always
of the same type if it was created with the functions in this package.
The validation functions will ensure this.

\section{Three types of monosaccharides}{
There are three types of monosaccharides:
\itemize{
\item concrete: e.g. "Gal", "GlcNAc", "Glc", "Fuc", etc.
\item generic: e.g. "Hex", "HexNAc", "HexA", "HexN", etc.
\item simple: e.g. "H", "N", "S", "F".
}

For the full list of monosaccharides, see \code{glyrepr::monosaccharides}.
